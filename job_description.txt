Job Summary:
We are seeking a highly analytical Data Scientist to develop machine learning models, analyze complex datasets, and drive data-driven decision-making. The ideal candidate will have expertise in Python/R, SQL, and statistical modeling, with experience in deploying ML solutions. This role will collaborate with cross-functional teams to solve business challenges through predictive analytics and AI.

Key Responsibilities:
1. Data Analysis & Modeling
Develop and deploy machine learning models (supervised/unsupervised learning, NLP, computer vision, etc.).

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and insights.

Build predictive models (regression, classification, clustering) to solve business problems.

2. Data Engineering & Preprocessing
Clean, transform, and analyze large datasets using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) or R.

Optimize data pipelines for big data (Spark, Hadoop, SQL).

Work with APIs, databases (SQL/NoSQL), and cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure).

3. AI/ML Deployment
Productionize ML models using MLflow, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Flask/Django.

Implement A/B testing and model performance monitoring.

4. Business Insights & Collaboration
Translate technical findings into actionable insights for stakeholders.

Partner with engineering, product, and marketing teams to drive data initiatives.

5. Research & Innovation
Stay updated with latest AI/ML trends (LLMs, generative AI, deep learning).

Recommend improvements to existing models and algorithms.

Domain Expertise (Healthcare, Finance, E-commerce)

Education & Experience:
Bachelor’s/Master’s in Data Science, Computer Science, Statistics, or related field.

3+ years of hands-on experience in ML model development & deployment.

Why Join Us?
Work on cutting-edge AI/ML projects.

Competitive salary + equity/stocks (if applicable).

Flexible work environment (remote-friendly).

How to Apply:
Submit your resume, GitHub, and portfolio (if applicable) with:

Examples of ML projects (Kaggle, research papers, deployed models).

Brief explanation of your most impactful data science contribution.

ATS Optimization Tips:
Use standard job titles (e.g., "Data Scientist" instead of "AI Wizard").

Include keywords from the job description in the resume.

Avoid images/tables in resumes (ATS can’t read them).

Mention tools/technologies explicitly (e.g., "Scikit-learn," not just "ML").
